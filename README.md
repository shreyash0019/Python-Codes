# Python Code Repository

This repository contains Python code examples demonstrating the usage of `for` loops and `while` loops.

## Examples

### For Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or range). Here's an example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)



# while loop
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(f"Counter is {counter}")
    counter += 1 

This README now provides a concise explanation of the repository and instructions to run the code. You can copy and paste it directly!
